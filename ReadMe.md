# BuildBuddy AI Chatbot Test

## Description

The purpose of this landing page is to serve as a test to see if there is interest in an AI Chatbot as part of the BuildBuddy experience.

## Features

The website should have a clean and simple layout, with little complexity. On the hero section should be an interactive demo of the Chatbot that aligns with the following criteria:
    - The Chatbot sends a conversation opener message.
    - A user can input a message and send it back to the Chatbot.
    - The users message should be saved to a CSV for data capturing purposes and to understand what users are looking for.
    - The Chatbot should prompt the user to register to continue using it and get answers.

## Getting Started

The website will be accessible using GitHub Pages for testing purposes when it is ready. A link will be added below when deployed.
